    Web Services Agreement
    This Agreement is between you and AOL (UK) Limited (AOL, we or us).

    This AOL Web Services Agreement (the Agreement) applies to your use of AOL's web sites (including but not limited to aol.co.uk and HuffingtonPost.co.uk), as well as other pages, information, software, services, products and content which may be operated, hosted or managed by AOL or its affiliates (together, the AOL Web Services). Some of these products and services may require your use of a Screen Name, and this Agreement contains terms which are applicable to the use of such products and services.

    Please be aware that AOL's websites may include content from other countries or sources where separate terms of use may apply. It is your responsibility to read the applicable terms of use that appear in the footer of each page and if you do not agree to those terms, then please leave the site. Your continued use of any AOL site or affiliate site will be deemed to be your acceptance of the applicable terms

    By using AOL Web Services as a casual visitor, or by completing the registration process to obtain and use a Screen Name or User Name, you signify that you agree to this Agreement.

    Please print and/or save a downloaded copy of the Agreement on your computer for your reference. The terms of this Agreement may be updated or additional terms may apply, from time to time. Each time you visit AOL Web Services please look out for these notices of updates and when you see these read and print and/or save a downloaded copy.   Your continued use of any of the AOL Web Services will be taken as your consent and agreement to any changes or updates we may make to this Agreement.

    As protecting your privacy is important, we would like you to have a clear understanding of how your personal information will be used when you use the AOL Web Services or register for any of our products or services.

    1. Personal Information

    1.1. Personal Information is information that identifies you, including identity and billing information that you may provide to AOL or AOL may collect through your use of the AOL Web Services (Personal Information). Your Personal Information will be collected, processed, stored and used by us, and passed to and processed by us and our affiliate companies (together AOL Group Companies) and other data processors acting under our control, in order to provide the Services, to provide customer support and for other purposes described in our Privacy Policy.

    1.2. Our Privacy Policy sets out Seven Principles of Privacy that AOL commits to. To find out more, visit Privacy Policy and, if you are a user of AOL software via AOL Keyword: Privacy.

    1.3. AOL and any third parties acting under our control may use your Personal Information (including demographic data) to personalise the content, advertising and promotions you receive and where you have consented to receive them,  our communications with you, AOL may do this by finding out which advertisements you react to or the areas of the AOL Web Services which you visit most frequently, or searches you perform when using the AOL Web Services, and tailoring your experience accordingly. We may also process Personal Information relating to the transactions you enter into with us or our partners, such as online merchants, through the AOL Web Services. To find out more if you are a user of AOL Software visit AOL Keyword: Marketing Preferences, or if you have a Web Services Account visit Marketing Preferences.

    1.4. We may also use cookies - small files of data which may be automatically stored on your computer's hard drive when your Web browser accesses certain Web pages. Cookies enable us to provide a better service to you. More information about how we (and third parties) may use cookies and similar technologies (and how to opt out of receiving them) is provided in our Privacy Policy, or to find out more visit: What are cookies, or if you are a user of AOL software via AOL Keyword: Cookies.

    1.5. AOL Group Companies may keep you informed of their respective products and services (including special offers, discounts, offers, competitions). AOL Group Companies may also keep you informed by post, telephone, email, SMS, and MMS of such products and services offered by third parties selected by AOL which may be of interest to you. AOL or AOL Group Companies will only send you third parties' marketing information with your informed consent.  To find out more, if you use the AOL software visit Keyword: Marketing Preferences, or if you have a Web Services Account visit Marketing Preferences. See also clause 1.10 below.

    1.6. Your Personal Information, including content that relates to your Personal Information (for example, email communications, comments, instant messages, etc)  may be disclosed if we or an entity processing your data on our behalf are compelled to do so by law, or receive a valid, legally compliant request by a law enforcement or governmental authority. If you provide us a third party's billing or payment card information, we may disclose your name and address, and data relating to payments made by that payment method, to such third parties.

    1.7. If you provide us with payment or billing information (such as a payment card number), you agree that AOL Group Companies and its authorised data processors shall have the right to collect, store and process those details and any related Personal Information for the purpose of providing, maintaining, billing, fulfilment, monitoring usage of and making service improvements to the AOL Web Services.

    1.8. For an unlimited period after your AOL Web Services Account has been cancelled we may retain any payment-related information, such as a payment card number, which you supply to us (but only in an anonymised form which does not enable us to identify the holder of that payment method), for fraud prevention purposes.

    1.9. AOL Web Services are multi-national, and many of the computers and companies that process data on our behalf are based in other countries outside the European Union (EU) including the USA. We may collect Personal Information (which may include data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, or concerning health or sex life), but we will not use this without your explicit consent. All Personal Information may be transferred to, processed and held both inside and outside the EU. Countries outside the EU may not have as well developed data protection laws in place to protect your information as those inside the EU, but we will ensure your Personal Information is treated in compliance with those laws, this Agreement and our Privacy Policy. Details of companies and countries processing your data will be provided on request, details of how to contact us are contained in our Privacy Policy, for more information visit: Privacy Policy.

    1.10. We encourage you to tell us what your marketing preferences are for your Personal Information. Unless and until you opt-out, your name and contact details may be (a) used by AOL Group Companies for a reasonable period after your use of AOL Web Services ceases, and (b) passed to selected third party suppliers of goods and services and advertisers for 6 months after you cease to be a user of AOL Web Services, for marketing goods and services to you. To notify us of your preferences, if you use the AOL Software visit Keyword: Marketing Preferences, or if you have a Web Services Account visit: Marketing Preferences.

    2. Registration

    2.1. Whilst enjoyment of some of the AOL Web Services does not require registration and can be accessed as a casual visitor, access to other AOL Web Services requires completion of a simple registration process in order to obtain a screen name and password necessary to enjoy such services.

    2.2. We will open an account for you when you complete your registration via either www.aol.co.uk or via www.huffingtonpost.co.uk (the Web Services Account and the HuffPost Web Services Account respectively and together, the AOL Web Services Account). You must provide complete and accurate information about yourself, and notify us to keep this information up to date. You must be at least 18 years old to register for either a Screen Name or a User Name. Parents and guardians who permit children (by which we mean people under the age of 18) for whom they are responsible to use AOL Web Services should assist them in setting up their AOL Web Services Account and supervise their use of AOL Web Services. Parents and guardians will be responsible for their children's use of the AOL Web Services and adherence to this Agreement and it is also the responsibility of parents and guardians to ensure that the AOL Web Content and User Generated Content that their children may encounter on AOL Web Services is suitable for those children. Most of that content is not specifically intended to be accessed by children.

    2.2.1 Where you register for a Web Services Account, you will select (or we may assign to you) a master screen name that will be identified with your AOL Web Services Account (Master Screen Name). In some instances AOL may offer you the opportunity to obtain further secondary screen names which become associated with your AOL Web Services Account (collectively Screen Name(s)).

    2.2.2 Where you register for a HuffPost Web Services Account, you will select (or we may assign to you) a user name that will be identified with your HuffPost Web Services Account (User Name).

    2.3. You may not apply for a Screen Name or User Name  that is used by someone else, is vulgar, attempts to impersonate another person or violates the rights of others. We may reject any Screen Name or User Name that we determine in our discretion is unacceptable for use on any of the AOL Web Services. All Screen Names and User Names remain the exclusive property of AOL. AOL provides you with a limited, revocable, non-exclusive licence to use your Screen Name(s) or User Name to access the AOL Web Services.

    2.4. You need to select a password to access your AOL Web Services Account. Your password is the key that unlocks your AOL Web services Account. AOL will never ask you for your password. You agree not to reveal your password to other users. Your AOL Web Services Account is at risk if you let someone use it inappropriately. You agree to indemnify and hold AOL harmless for any improper or illegal use of your AOL Web Services Account, including illegal or improper use by a third party who has used your password to access your AOL Web Services Account.

You warrant that you will use any Software which may provide you with in accordance with this Agreement and that you will not use the Software to violate any law, regulation or right of any third party.

    12. Our Liability to You

    12.1. The AOL Web Services are provided without warranties of any kind and your use of AOL Web Services is at your sole risk. AOL will, however, use reasonable skill and care to provide and maintain the availability of AOL Web Services. AOL and its affiliates expressly exclude any warranty, representation or undertaking that you will be able to access or use the AOL Web Services at times or locations of your choosing. AOL depends upon third parties over which it may have little or no control for the delivery of the AOL Web Services (for example, to deliver emails sent to and from internet addresses). AOL is not liable for deletion, corruption or failure to store any email messages or other content. AOL does not warrant that the AOL Web Services will be free from any virus, worm, Trojan horse or other program or device that is apparently intended to access and modify, delete or damage data files or computer programs. The AOL Web Services are consumer services and not designed to be used by you in connection with the conduct of your, or your employers' or contractors', commercial activities. If you choose to do so, it is entirely at your own, and your employer's or contractor's, risk.

    12.2. AOL shall not be liable for any loss not reasonably foreseeable by AOL when this Agreement is entered into, nor for any loss of data, profit, revenue or business or wasted expenditure, howsoever caused, arising from your use of the AOL Web Services or for any other claim related in any way to your relationship with AOL. AOL does not endorse, warrant or guarantee any product or service offered by a third party, and will not be a party to, or responsible for monitoring, any transaction between you and such a third party. We shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performance of our obligations under this Agreement caused by matters beyond our reasonable control.

    12.3. Without limiting the above paragraph (and except for AOL's liability for death or personal injury caused by its negligence, for which AOL's liability shall be unlimited), the liability of AOL under or in connection with this Agreement or your use of the AOL Web Services (whether arising in negligence or otherwise) will not under any circumstances exceed ??500, regardless of the cause or form of action. Your statutory rights are unaffected.

    13. Indemnification

    13.1. You agree to defend and indemnify harmless AOL and AOL Group Companies against all liabilities, claims and expenses, including reasonable legal fees that arise from any infringement of third party intellectual property or other rights resulting from any breach of this Agreement for which you are responsible. AOL reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defence and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you. In that event, you shall have no further obligation to provide indemnification for AOL in that matter.

    14. Termination

    14.1. Save as otherwise expressly provided in any additional terms governing the use of specific AOL Web Services (for example Premium Services), we do not charge you for use of AOL Web Services, and as a consequence, we may cancel or suspend use of AOL Web Services at any time, without cause and without notice.

    14.2. Your right to use the AOL Web Services and your Screen Name(s)and User Names  may end once your account is terminated and any data you have stored on the AOL Web Services may no longer be available to you (save for that expressly set out in clause 14.4 below). It is therefore important you maintain your own archive copies of any data that is valuable to you. If you have subscribed to any Premium Services or other products or services for which payment is necessary, you remain responsible for paying any amounts owed on your account at the time your Premium Service and/or account is terminated. If you are participating in any free promotional offer for accessing a Premium Service you must cancel such Premium Service before the end of the free trial period to avoid incurring charges.

    14.3. Termination, suspension, cancellation of the AOL Web Services Account(s) and AOL Access Account(s).

    14.3.1. If you have an account for AOL Broadband internet access and/or AOL Dial Up/ Narrowband internet access (the AOL Access Account) and the AOL Access Account is suspended, cancelled or terminated for breach of its terms and conditions of service, AOL reserves the right to suspend, cancel or terminate any or all associated AOL Web Services Account(s) you may have, at any time, without notice.

    14.3.2. You acknowledge and agree, as AOL Access Accounts and AOL Web Services Accounts are interlinked that termination, suspension or cancellation of your AOL Web Services Account, for any reason, may mean that you are not able to continue to use your Screen Name to access AOL Access Accounts, and/or AOL Software.

    14.4. If you wish to terminate your AOL Web Services Account you may:

    Simply discontinue your use of your AOL Web Services Account; or alternatively:
